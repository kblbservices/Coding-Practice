    <h2 class="yellow">Universal Selector</h2><br />
    indicated by <strong>*</strong> <br />
    will apply to EVERY element on the page
    <h2>Element Selector </h2> - particular elements selected. can also style 2 or more elements <br />
    using a comma inbetween selectors ie. h1, h2 {} <br />
    ID Selector - can be used in an element attribute as a hook for css<br />
    in the CSS the id seletor is indicated with <strong>#id name</strong>
    <Button id="pella">Sign Up</Button>
    <button>pick me!</button>
    <P>
    <h2>Class Selector</h2><br />
    like the id selector, but used to style a group of elements<br />
    in the html, the class will be indicated as an attribute to the chosen group of elements called class= <br />
    in the CSS the class seletor is indicated with <strong class="yellow">.class name</strong>
    </P>
    <p><h2>Descnedant Selectors</h2> <br />
    Used to select all elements that are nested in another element <br />
    Unlike styling 2 different elements separated by a comma, Descendatnts are <br />
    separated by a space ie li a {color: red} - the li will not be styled, <br />
    the anchor tags nested insilde a list will be styled
